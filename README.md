# secure-sw-dev-fundamentals: Secure Software Development Fundamentals courses (from the OpenSSF Best Practices WG)

This repository is for managing and sharing the content of the
*Secure Software Development Fundamentals*
courses (from the OpenSSF Best Practices WG) that are available via the
[Linux Foundation Training &amp; Certification Platform](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/training/developing-secure-software-lfd121/)
and via [edX](http://edx.org/professional-certificate/linuxfoundationx-secure-software-development-fundamentals?utm_medium=partner-marketing&utm_source=affiliate&utm_campaign=openssf&utm_content=openssforg-securedevelopmentpc).
If you see something that should be changed, please
[file an issue](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/issues).

If you just want to *take* these courses, please [select the course you are interested in and take it](https://openssf.org/training/courses/).

See the [*Secure Software Development Fundamentals* content converted into Markdown format](secure_software_development_fundamentals.md) for the main content of this repository.

This informational content is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY) version 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt), so you can reuse it in many ways. We want you to use this information! There are some exceptions: we quote other material (such as from xkcd) which are under their own licenses, and to counter cheating we do not release certain testing materials this way. Note that we update this material, so you should be prepared for updates if you use a significant portion of it.

If you earn a certificate of completion for the course via the Linux Foundation (LF) Training, you can show off the [digital credentials (badges) you've earned](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/badges-2/). Similarly, if you earn a course certificate or program certificate on edX, you can [show your edX certificates](https://www.edx.org/verified-certificate).

If you want to propose changes to the content, the preferred mechanism is
to file [issues](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/issues) for general suggestions and provide [pull requests](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals/pulls) for specific changes, in both cases to this
[secure-sw-dev-fundamentals](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals)
project. Changes that are accepted into the Markdown then go through a series of internal steps to be deployed to both the LF Training and edX platforms.

This content was originally converted from Google docs format using
[gdocs2md](http://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md),
patched to skip inline drawings.
That project unfortunately seems to have stalled.
Alternative converters include
[lmmx/gdocs2md-html](https://github.com/lmmx/gdocs2md-html)
and
[evbacher/gd2md-html](https://github.com/evbacher/gd2md-html!)
(the last one is most recently active).

Our thanks to Flavia Cioanca for her work to convert the text into live courses!
