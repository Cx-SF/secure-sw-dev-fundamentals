# secure-sw-dev-fundamentals: Secure Software Development Fundamentals edX courses (from the OpenSSF Best Practices WG)

This repository is for managing and sharing the content of the
*Secure Software Development Fundamentals*
courses (from the OpenSSF Best Practices WG) that are available via edX.
If you see something that should be changed, please file an issue.

If you just want to *take* these courses, please [select the course you are interested in and take it on edX](https://openssf.org/edx-courses/).

See the [*Secure Software Development Fundamentals* content converted into Markdown format](secure_software_development_fundamentals.md) for the main content of this repository.

This informational content is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY) version 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt), so you can reuse it in many ways. We want you to use this information! There are some exceptions: we quote other material (such as from xkcd) which are under their own licenses, and to counter cheating we do not release certain testing materials this way.

This content was converted from Google docs format using
[gdocs2md](http://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md),
patched to skip inline drawings.
That project unfortunately seems to have stalled.
A newer one is [lmmx/gdocs2md-html](https://github.com/lmmx/gdocs2md-html)
though that seems to have stalled later on.
If you have a special need you may request
view access to the [content in Google Docs form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oN6juqVR7KXuvclHvoY0pr_XQmC6t6uXMLcYphPsUsA/edit?usp=sharing). Please justify why you need it this unusual access; you almost certainly don't need it, since the content is the same.
If you want to propose changes to the content, the preferred mechanism is
via issues and pull requests.

Our thanks to Flavia Cioanca for her work to convert the text into a live course!
