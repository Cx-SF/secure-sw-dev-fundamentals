This repository is for managing and sharing the content of the

If you see something that should be changed, please file an issue.

See the [*Secure Software Development Fundamentals* content converted into Markdown format](secure_software_development_fundamentals.md) for the main content of this repository.

This informational content is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY) version 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt), so you can reuse it in many ways. We want you to use this information! There are some exceptions: we quote other material (such as from xkcd) which are under their own licenses, and to counter cheating we do not release certain testing materials this way. Note that we update this material, so you should be prepared for updates if you use a significant portion of it.

This content was originally converted from Google docs format using
[gdocs2md](http://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md),
patched to skip inline drawings.
That project unfortunately seems to have stalled.
A newer one is [lmmx/gdocs2md-html](https://github.com/lmmx/gdocs2md-html)
though that seems to have stalled later on.
If you want to propose changes to the content, the preferred mechanism is
via issues and pull requests to the
[secure-sw-dev-fundamentals](https://github.com/ossf/secure-sw-dev-fundamentals)
project.

Our thanks to Flavia Cioanca for her work to convert the text into a live course!
