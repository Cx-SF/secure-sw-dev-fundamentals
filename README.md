Secure Software Development Fundamentals edX courses (from the OpenSSF Best Practices WG)

This repository is for managing the Secure Software Development Fundamentals
courses (from the OpenSSF Best Practices WG) available via edX.
If you see something that should be changed, please file an issue.

The informational content is released under the [Creative Commons Attribution License (CC-BY) version 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.txt), so you can reuse it in many ways. We want you to use this information! There are some exceptions: we quote other material (such as from xkcd) which are under their own licenses, and to counter cheating we do not release certain testing materials this way.

You can see the [content converted into Markdown format](secure_software_development_fundamentals.md).
This was converted from Google docs format using
[gdocs2md](http://github.com/mangini/gdocs2md),
patched to skip inline drawings.
Currently the conversion needs some cleaning; help is welcome!
The plan is to convert the markdown to be identical to the Google docs
version; we can then entertain technical improvements to the content itself.

The original [content in Google Docs form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oN6juqVR7KXuvclHvoY0pr_XQmC6t6uXMLcYphPsUsA/edit) is also available but you may need to request access.

If you just want to *take* these courses, please [select the course you are interested in and take it on edX](https://openssf.org/edx-courses/).
